## Siwa Oracle 
*prototype 2 // February 18, 2023*

## OVERVIEW:
    This code base provides a CLI for running and interacting various data production algorithms which are then collected by another service and saved to the blockchain. 

## Setup:
    You should run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    Each feed may itself require separate setup. 
    See the /feeds directory and the readme.md files therein

## Files:
* `siwa.py` - provides CLI interface / thread handling
* `siwa_logging.py` log handler to log to SQLite
* `endpoint.py` http/json endpoint, run automatically via siwa CLI, or standalone
* `all_feeds.py` - all enabled datafeeds from `feeds/`
* `feeds/data_feed.py` - defines class structure shared by all datafeeds
* `feeds/*.py` - e.g. `gauss.py` - defines an individual datafeed

## Examples:
    endpoint example: http://127.0.0.1:16556/datafeed/gauss
    (you may need to pre-populate by running gauss for a second)
